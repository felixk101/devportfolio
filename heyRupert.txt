Hey Rupert,
a little bird told me that you might be interested in a
particular game, namely a game of cunning, of resolve, of 
planning and dealing with failure. At beginning of the game,
you will start out with a small, pitiful collection of people.
But with time and diligence, your scrap of land will become
irrefutably yours. Much will stand in your way: The weather,
raiders, sickness, insanity, and vicious animals. But if you
tame the animals, repel the raiders and keep your population
happy (and manage to not starve), you'll eventually be able to
depart that particular hellhole... And fly to a nicer one.
And now... read the first letter of every line :)
Yours Truly, Felix <3
